## Features

- **No server or database required** – Generates QR codes locally without external dependencies.
- **Personalized QR codes** – Each generated QR code links to a Google Form with a pre-filled user name.
- **Automated pre-filling** – Users scanning the QR code will see their name already entered in the form field.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/)

## Installation

### Using Pip

If you're not using NixOS, you can install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Create A Google Form

- Add a field that will store user names.
- The script currently supports only one field for names.

### 2. Get The Pre-Filled Link

- Click the three-dot menu (top-right of the form editor).
- Select **"Get pre-filled link"**.
- Enter any placeholder value in the name field.
- Click **"Get link"** and copy the generated URL.

### 3. Extract Required Values

From the copied URL:

```
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/{your_form_id}/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.{your_form_field_id}={your_value}
```

Identify:

- `your_form_id` → The unique Google Form ID.
- `your_form_field_id` → The field entry number.
- `your_value` → Can be ignored since we only need it to get the entry number.

### 4. Create And Configure The `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project folder and add:

```
FORM_ID=your_form_id
USERS=John Doe,Jane Smith,Bob Johnson
ENTRY=your_entry_here
```

### 5. Link The Form To A Google Sheet

- Open the Google Form.
- Go to the **Responses** tab.
- Click **"Link to Sheets"** to save responses automatically.

### 6. Run The Script

Execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 7. Verify QR Code Generation

- A folder named `qr_codes` will be created.
- It will contain personalized QR codes for each user in the `.env` file.
- These QR codes will direct users to the Google Form with their name pre-filled.

## Customization

The script currently supports only a single name field, but it can be modified to handle additional fields if needed.
